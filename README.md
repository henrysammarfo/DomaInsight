# DomaInsight

AI-Driven Domain Scoring & Predictive Analytics dApp for the Doma Protocol Hackathon (Track 4: Trait Scoring & Analytics). Built for submission by Sept 12, 2025, using live Doma testnet dataâ€”no mocks. Solves the problem of opaque domain valuation in DomainFi by scoring traits (e.g., length, keywords, TLD rarity) with AI, capturing trends, and driving on-chain actions (e.g., tokenization) to boost txns/users/revenue by 5-10x.

## Project Overview
- **Track**: Trait Scoring & Analytics
- **Goal**: Build an MVP that scores domain rarity using on-chain data from Doma's subgraph, visualizes trends, and provides DeFi recommendations with one-click actions.
- **Features**:
  - Real-time trait scoring (AI model, 0-100 score based on length, keywords, TLD, txns).
  - Trend analytics dashboard (Recharts heatmaps, basic predictions).
  - Actionable recs (e.g., "Tokenize domain") with live testnet txns via Doma APIs.
  - Multi-chain state sync for real-time data.
  - Simple alert for expiring high-score domains.
- **Impact**: Increases trading volume, attracts users with free analytics, generates protocol fees.

## Doma Protocol Usage
- **Subgraph**: Queries live domain metadata (name, TLD, expiry, owner, txns).
- **APIs/SDKs**: Reseller API for tokenization; smart contracts for actions.
- **State Sync**: Multi-chain data for real-time accuracy.
- **Testnet**: All features tested on https://start.doma.xyz/, logging txns/users/revenue potential.

## Track Goals Addressed
- Scores domain traits/rarity with AI, outperforming web2 metrics.
- Captures market trends (e.g., TLD demand) for informed trades.
- Drives on-chain activity: txns via tokenization/auctions, user onboarding, fee generation.
